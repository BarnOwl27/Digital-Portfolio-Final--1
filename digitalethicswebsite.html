        <p>For this website, the whole class made it for our showcase. We were all put into teams that had a page in this website. Then we were given our own pages to make. Working with a team was very helpful but also hard to manage. Although, we had altercations about time management we ended up finishing our part of the website. </p>

        <p>The Tourism Website was one of my biggest accomplishments during my first year at CART. I completed the website and liked the way it turned out. Along with doing all of it in time and adding details to it to make it really feel like a website. </p>

        <p>These are some of the games I made. Check out my three game projects I did during my two years at CART. I developed two of them with teams and one I made all on my own!</p>
