        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello there, my name is Lilyanna Altamirano.

I am a Senior at Clovis High and I graduate in 2022.  I am concurrently attending the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) to pursue a career in Video Game Designing.  I am enrolled in Interactive Game Design, and last year I was in Web Application Development. My educational experience allows me to be well versed in entry-level programming in multiple languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a broad understanding of the aspects of creating art, story, and level design in Game Design. I plan on working in the Gaming industry as a developer and producer of games and be a part of one of the gaming companies.
  </p>
        <p>I enjoy playing instruments such as violin, guitar, and piano. In my free time, I play alot of video games. Thank you for your time and effort.  I look forward to explaining more in depth about my skills, abilities with people, and with technology below. Feel free to contact me.
