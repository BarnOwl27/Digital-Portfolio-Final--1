          <p>Dear Website Visitors:</p>
          <p>My educational experience enables me to be well versed in entry-level programming in multiple languages and understanding the aspects of creating art, story, and level design in Game Design.  I will be graduating from Clovis High in the year w-2022 in May.  I plan on working in the Gaming Industry as a developer and producer of games and being a part of one of the gaming companies.  In the near future, I will be gaining as much experience with jobs while pursuing a Ph.D. degree in computer science.  After I finish my degree I will apply to a gaming companies such as Santa Monica Studios, Ubisoft, and Sony for a job. </p>
          <p>Throughout my academics, I have developed a lot of experience in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I have maintained a 3.7 GPA and higher for my high school career and plan to continue through college.  Cart has also been a really good place for me to gain experience in my industry.  My projects such as my Tourism Website and a game I created in GDevelop called La Paz.  Both show my abilities in art and programming making my ideal for the gaming industry.  During my years at CART, I have collaborated with incredible and talented people to create games.  I played a part in 3D modeling objects for the game and communicated effectively with the programmers and level designers.  I managed the amount of work I was given.  I strongly think that I am prepared to enter the Gaming industry and ready to learn from it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and effort.  I look forward to explaining more in-depth about my skills, abilities with people, and with technology in the hiring process. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
