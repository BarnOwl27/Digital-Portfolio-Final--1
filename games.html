        <p>For CART’s final project for Interactive Game Design my group decided to go for a 2D project and use software called Unity. I used piskel for the 2D art of the game and learned more things about what is possible with layers and shortcuts.  A challenge I faced was the overall theme of the game and what kind of style I wanted the game to portray. Cart’s Habit of mind helped remind me I should communicate with my team to get their opinion on it and create the 2D art of the final project.  When I received their feedback it made the art look really good and overall looks great in the game. The password to the game is cart2022.</p>

        <p>When I was assigned this project it was with another classmate. We developed this website for UI and understanding creative writing and storytelling. We coded an interactive game that allows the player to go throught the story and make there own decisons that effected the story. We developed this using replit and the tools it provided us such as, the inspect tools, the console, and coloring of the code. We looked up HTML and CSS languages and how to add effects to make the website more entertaining.</p>

        <p>When developing this project I used piskel, a pixel art format for the art of the game. I set out to make a gothic art style for my game and created all of the mechanics on a software called GDevelope. I learned how to do shortcuts for piskel and make the process a lot faster. For the coding part I created shortcuts and reused the same code for the next scenes. The big challenge was to create an inventor system for GDevelop because there was nothing for it and the inventory system in the software was not working so I created my own. By using CART’s habits of mind I persisted in this challenge determined to get an inventory to work in my game. I ended up successfully making my game with inventory.

        <p>The Tourism Website was one of my biggest accomplishments during my first year at CART. I completed the website and liked the way it turned out. Along with doing all of it in time and adding details to it to make it really feel like a website.</p>
